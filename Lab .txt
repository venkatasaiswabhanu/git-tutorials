CONFIGURING GIT

    git config --global user.name "Username"
    git config --global user.email "mail id"
    git config --global color.ui "auto"
    If you want to set up note pad as your text editor
    $ git commit --global core.editor "'<path>'"
    $ git commit --global core.editor "'<C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe\'"
     //Press enter
     ("You can use any text editor)


     CREATING A DIRECTORY

     If you want create a directory and edit the content . the commands follows here
    $ mkdir <directory name>
    $ mkdir Project1

    After creating  directory we have to change to working directory using command $ cd      // if  you want to exit from directory enter $ cd  ..
    $ cd Project1  //check git status to check whether to add and commit the directoryor file

    To create a file in existing directory
    $ touch index.html

    check git status using command
     $ git status

    if you got Untracked file you need to move file to staging area which can be done using command
     $ git add .
    So that new file will be added

    Next step is to commit the changes which can be done using commands
    $ git commit -m "initial version"
    then you will get output  as 1 file changed

    finally check
    $git status  (to know whether it is moved to staging area)
    if you get output  "nothing to commit, working tree clean" you are perfect

    if you want to update html file
    echo "<html> </html> >> index.html
    you will get output as "Changes not made for commit"

    use
    $git add .
    to stage this file and then check "$ git status" (if you got changes to be commited then commit changes using command $ git commit)

    Finally it will open Note Pad Text editor to edit the things    

Everything is done

Remove Everything is done and add GIT HUB Tutorials in HTTP Repo File too..
